- npm i

## AI

Uses any OpenAI compatible API (including OpenAI's official one).

I recomment using the free application [gpt4all](https://gpt4all.io/index.html) with the Mistral OpenOrca model

This application can run a LLM for free on your PC, just remember to enable the API server in it's settings

## Environment variables

Create a .env file by copying the .env-sample file and edit it
Use <https://twitchapps.com/tmi> to get your oauth tokens

## Run with docker
